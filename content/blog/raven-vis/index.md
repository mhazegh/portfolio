title: The Raven - Visualized
date: "2015-09-28T22:40:32.169Z"
description: Inspired by Martin Wattenberg's The Shape of Song , I decided to create a similar visualization but using text as input rather than music. I used Edgar Allen Poe's The Raven for my first attempt. Each arc is a connection between one occurrence of a word and the next occurrence of that same word. The color of an arc is determined by the distance between the two occurrences, with colors ranging from green to red.
