title: Paths of Irrational Numbers
date: "2015-05-28T22:40:32.169Z"
description: For this visualization I used the first 1,000,000 digits of π, e, √2, and the Golden Ratio to create four numerically determined paths. A Java program scans over each digit of the irrational numbers. If the number is odd the path will make a left turn, if it's even a right turn will be made. All four paths are colored differently and then overlaid onto each other.
